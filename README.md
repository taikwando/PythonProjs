Project 1: Web Scraper

The first project I am working on in the Python language is a web scraper that I will use to pull data from various social media sites. What I will do with the data is yet to be determined but the process of building a webscraper that can scrape from three big social media sites (Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter) will make for good practice.
